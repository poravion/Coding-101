<h1> 10/10 Would Watch Again </h1>
<p> Super weird movie that my roommate and I watched where this little cat steals back his sister's soul and then goes on a crazy psychedelic adventure but then ends up completely alone </p>
<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Soup" target="_blank"> Check it, kids</a> 
<p> Reasons why this movie was sick af </p>
<ol> <li> The sounds were all isolated and made for a weird effect </li>
<li> The animation was so vivid, you didn't need dialogue </li>
<li> It was the good kinda creepy where you can't tear your eyes away from the screen </li> </ol>
